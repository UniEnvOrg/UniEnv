# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 0.0.1b5 (2025-12-09)

- Added a `is_multiprocessing_safe` attribute to `ReplayBuffer` and `StorageBase` class that tells users whether the workload of creating the replay buffer before forking the python process (commonly used for pytorch dataloading) can be used.
- Add backward compatibility for the `FlattenedStorage` (the file it was implemented is moved to a different location, now we've added a compatibility mapping to map to the correct implementation file when loading from a legacy stored replay buffer)
- Bugfixed `flatten_data` implementations for `BinarySpace`

## 0.0.1b4 (2025-11-21)

Add DictStorage for mapping dictionary replay buffers with different keys.

## 0.0.1b3 (2025-11-13)

Removed integration with mujoco-playground and maniskill and moved them over to the `UniEnvAdaptors` package.

## 0.0.1b1 and 0.0.1b2 (2025-09-04)

Released first beta version of UniEnvPy on PyPI with unfinished world system support.
